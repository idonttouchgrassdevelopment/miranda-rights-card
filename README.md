Config = {}

-- Miranda Rights text configuration
-- Each line will be displayed as a separate paragraph
Config.MirandaRights = {
    "You have the right to remain silent.",
    "Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.",
    "You have the right to an attorney.",
    "If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.",
    "Do you understand the rights I have just read to you?",
    "With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?"
}

-- UI Configuration
Config.UISettings = {
    Title = "MIRANDA WARNING",
    AcknowledgeButtonText = "I Understand",
    CloseButtonText = "Close"
}

-- Command Configuration
Config.Command = "miranda"
Config.DefaultKeybind = "F9"
```

### Changing the Appearance
